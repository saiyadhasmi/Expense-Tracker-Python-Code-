# Python Expense Tracker (Beginner Project)

## Overview
This is my first Python project, created to practice and demonstrate a strong understanding of Python fundamentals such as variables, user input, type conversion, and basic arithmetic operations.

The program allows users to enter their daily budget and expenses across different categories, then calculates the total amount spent and the remaining balance. The project focuses on writing clean, readable, and beginner-friendly code while solving a real-world problem: personal expense tracking.

## Project Objectives
- Understand how to use variables to store and manage user data
- Practice taking input from users using the `input()` function
- Learn how to convert string input into numbers using `int()`
- Perform basic mathematical calculations
- Display clean and formatted output using `print()`
- Build confidence by completing and publishing a full Python project on GitHub

---

## Concepts Covered
This project focuses on the following Python basics:

- **Variables** – Store user data such as name, budget, and expenses  
- **User Input (`input()`)** – Accept values from the user through the terminal  
- **Type Conversion (`int()`)** – Convert input data into numbers for calculations  
- **Arithmetic Operations** – Addition and subtraction for calculating totals and balances  
- **Print Formatting** – Displaying results in a clean and readable format

## How the Program Works (Step-by-Step)

1. The program asks the user to enter their name.
2. The user enters their daily budget.
3. The user enters the names and prices of three food items.
4. The program calculates the total food expense.
5. The user enters transport and other expenses.
6. The program calculates the total amount spent.
7. The remaining balance is calculated by subtracting total expenses from the daily budget.
8. A formatted daily expense report is displayed on the screen.

This process is repeated for multiple users to simulate a real-world scenario where more than one person is tracking expenses.
